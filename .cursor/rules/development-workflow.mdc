# Development Workflow

## Project Setup
1. Install dependencies: `python install_requirements.py`
2. Test command-line version: `python pdf_to_markdown.py`
3. Start web interface: `python start_webui.py`

## Development Process
1. **Feature Development**: Add new heading detection patterns to `detect_headings()`
2. **Testing**: Test with various PDF formats and document types
3. **Documentation**: Update [README.md](mdc:README.md) with new features
4. **Code Review**: Ensure both Chinese and English documentation are updated

## Testing Guidelines
- Test with academic papers, technical documents, and regulatory files
- Verify heading hierarchy preservation
- Check Chinese text handling
- Validate web interface functionality
- Test file upload and download processes

## Code Organization
- Keep core logic in `pdf_to_markdown.py` for command-line use
- Web interface in [app.py](mdc:app.py) should reuse core functions
- Maintain consistency between command-line and web versions
- Use shared utility functions for common operations

## Deployment Considerations
- Ensure all dependencies are documented in `install_requirements.py`
- Test cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Verify file encoding handling for international users
- Consider performance optimization for large PDF files
